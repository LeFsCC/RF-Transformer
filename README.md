- Description: This repo hosts the hardware and software for the implementation of RF-Transformer. RF-Transformer provides a programmable interface to the micro-controller, allowing IoT devices to synthesize different types of protocol-compliant backscatter signals sharing radically different PHY-layer designs.

# License
The hardware and software source code of the RF-Transformer platform is distributed under academic license to ensure the reproducibility of our results. The hardware and software can NOT be used for commercial purpose.

# Hardware and software
hardware includes the files needed for fabricating the RF-Transformer PCB board.
PCB.PcbDoc is the file of PCB layout.

software includes the files needed for the backscatter signal generation.
